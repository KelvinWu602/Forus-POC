# Forus-POC
This Python script repository will be used for prototyping and proof of concept. As I believe the best way to showcase or document complicated algorithm is to write down pseudocode for that, and Python is the language best suit this purpose.

For each version of algorithm design, it will have a corresponding POC. Eg. Algo V1 → POC1. Algo V2 → POC2, …

Whenever we need to revise the algorithm design, please create a new POC branch to validate its correctness. It will also serve as a blueprint for later Golang implementation, therefore please pay attention to code structure (no spaghetti code lol) 

At the end, the main branch will merge the best version of POC. And we will start implementing it in Golang.

# Usage

**Just one rule: The complete version of POC x will be in branch `POCx`**

E.g. code for *POC1* will be in `POC1`.


If at anytime you want to add new features and test your ideas before telling others in the team, you can create an experiment branch `experiment(yyyy-mm-dd)` and validate your hypothesis. Once it works, you can merge it into a new POC branch. **Just make sure you don't use an existing POC number**. Then ask teammates to update the algorithm documentation in correspondence.
